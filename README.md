## Something about me 

I am a programmer with a passion for learning and creating. I'm well skilled in Python, Django and Flask frameworks, HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. I'm also familiar with SQL and NoSQL databases, HTTP protocol, and REST APIs. Currently learning React and the .NET framework.

I consider myself a Full-Stack developer but am more drawn to the Backend :)
