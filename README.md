## Something about me and my projects

I am a self-taught programmer with a passion for learning and creating. I'm well skilled in Python, Django and Flask frameworks, HTML and CSS. I'm also familiar with SQL and NoSQL databases, HTTP protocol and REST APIs. Currently learning Java.

I consider myself a Full-Stack developer but am more drawn to the Backend.
 
As you can see in some of my projects, I do not use error handling with try/except blocks much even though I know error handling is a must. It's just due to better readability and understanding of the code for beginners as well. 
Of course, I can write code with error handling, please check my project "Inventory Management System using Flask and MongoDB" for example :)

Looking forward to collaborating with you!
