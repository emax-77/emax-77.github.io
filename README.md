## Something about me 

I am a self-taught programmer with a passion for learning and creating. I'm well skilled in Python, Django and Flask frameworks, HTML and CSS. I'm also familiar with SQL and NoSQL databases, HTTP protocol and REST APIs. Currently learning Java.

I consider myself a Full-Stack developer but am more drawn to the Backend.
