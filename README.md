## Something about me 

I am a programmer with a passion for learning and creating. I'm well skilled in Python, Django and Flask frameworks, .NET with Visual Basic and C#, and some HTML/CSS/JS. I'm also familiar with SQL and NoSQL databases, HTTP protocol, and REST APIs. Currently learning .NET MAUI for mobile development and
some Linux so I can deploy my projects on my Ubuntu Server. The project Cycling-Club is online already.
