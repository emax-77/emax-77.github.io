## Something about me 

Software developer with experience in Python (Django, Flask) and .NET (C#, Visual Basic), as well as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Skilled in SQL and NoSQL databases, Git, REST APIs, and HTTP. Currently learning .NET MAUI, Linux, and Docker to deploy projects on an Ubuntu server.
The Cycling Club project is live. Earlier projects reflect my self-taught journey; since December 2024, I have been working professionally as a software developer.
