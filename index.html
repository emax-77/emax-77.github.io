        <h2>About me & My skills</h2>

        <p> I'm a 0b101110 year old technology and programming enthusiast.
            I'm good with Python and HTML, some CSS and JavaScript.
            At a basic level Java / Kotlin.
            I understand the Django framework and I have hands-on experience with
            MySQL, GIT / GitHub, Flask and various APIs. I like to learn new technologies quickly and easily.
            From previous positions I bring the ability to work under pressure, resilience to stress and
            the ability to solve problems independently.       
            I have over 250 solved assignments on <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/emax-77">Codewars</a>
            and have accumulated over 31,000 points on W3Schools.com 
            so far for the various courses I have taken with them. This number is still growing
            as I continue to use this platform to improve my skills.

            <p>My biggest project so far, focusing on the overall management of the cycling and touring club
                 of which I am a member and treasurer. I created it in Django, it implements login/registration,
                 email notification, charts, gallery, member registration for events and a few other things.
                 For more info, check out the README.md on GitHub.

            <p>Flask app which downloads meteorological data from Open-Meteo.com using their API, stores this data
                 in a MySQL database and then displays it on the page. Simplified version (just one python file)

            <p>"The Canteen" project is my new Django project that I started working on 11.09.2024. It should be a web app for ordering food
                 in a canteen. It will include login/registration, order system and order management with email notifications, contact form, 
                 payment system (not sure yet) and possibly some data exports. More info can be found in the README.md file on GitHub
                 in the coming days.

            <a href="https://github.com/emax-77">My other projects on GitHub</a>
            <p>On my GitHub you can find a few more small projects in Python like Exchange Rate List - a program that downloads
                 the current exchange rate ticket (CSV file) from the Slovak national bank, a TO-DO list in Django, 
                 a Twilio REST API to send SMS messages from your browser and a simple puzzle game I created as my very first Python program back in 2019.
